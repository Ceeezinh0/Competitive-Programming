# Competitive Programmer's Handbook - Antti Laaksonen

## Introduction

In Competitive Programming, we divide the subject into two main topics:
1. **Design (Logical Structure) of the Algorithm**: To design the algorithm, it is necessary to analyze the problem and solve it creatively. The algorithm must be solved correctly and as efficiently as possible.
2. **Implementation of the Algorithm**: The practical aspect of writing the algorithm in code.

## Programming Languages

The benefits of using **C++** include:
- Efficiency: C++ is known for its performance.
- Libraries: It contains various libraries and a vast collection of tools.
- Algorithm Structure: The format and structure are well-suited for competitive programming.

However, it is always good to master several languages and understand their strengths.

## Structural Template in C++

Below is a basic structural template in C++:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    return 0;
}
